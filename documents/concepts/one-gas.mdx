# One Gas (Universal Gas: $UXLINK)

## Overview

Pay for transaction fees using $UXLINK token from any source chain.

UXLINK’s One Gas (Universal gas) aims to address the fragmentation of gas tokens across blockchains, the inability for tokens to be used across chains, and the high cost of cross-chain transactions. One Gas allows users to use $UXLINK as the gas fee. With UXLINK’s unique One Gas feature, users only need to have $UXLINK in their account to cover transaction fees.

Typically, users must hold native tokens on each network to pay for transaction fees, which not only increases management overhead but also leads to fragmented funds. However, with One Gas, users only need to hold $UXLINK to pay for gas fees across multiple chains. One Gas dynamically calculates transaction fees in real-time for cross-chain transactions, achieving “one token for multi-chain payments.”

## Use One Gas

When executing transactions through One Gas, UXLINK’s Payment Hub uses an embedded dApp model (enabled via UXLINK’s transaction SDK and API), allowing users to directly pay gas fees with $UXLINK tokens. Users no longer need to switch between multiple tokens, as gas fees are automatically managed through UXLINK’s native Paymaster.

All gas fees are seamlessly settled between the source and destination chains, without incurring extra costs. As a result, users can pay transaction fees without needing to bridge or track cross-chain balances or maintain native token pools, offering a simplified cross-chain payment experience.
